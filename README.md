# fallout_hacking_game
A python3 replica of the "Fallout 3"'s minigame.

Here is the game I'm trying to replicate(in case you don't know it):

It also explains how to play the game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Execute the fallout_hacking.py file with python3 to play.

python3 fallout_hacking.py

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The game consists in cracking a password, you need to type one of the words you see on the screen,
and it will tell you how many letters in the right position you got right.
For example, if the password is 'HELLO', and you type 'WORLD', it will output '1/5 correct'.
Because the 4th letter, the 'L', was the only one that matched in the 5 letter word.
You only get 4 tries and it's over, so choose carefully.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This was made for my personal use, and that is why it is not properly commented and the code is a mess.
Also, even though I made it for personal use, you can feel free to use it in any way you want.
